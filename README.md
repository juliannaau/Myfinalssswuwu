# DESCRIPTION
>This system is an appointment management system designed to handle clients, services, and scheduled appointments. Clients can book appointments for different services, where each service has a specific duration. A client may have multiple appointments, but each appointment is linked to only one client and one service. The system stores appointment details such as date, time, and optional notes to properly organize and manage bookings.
